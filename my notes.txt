index has tf
find cf (collection frequency) by summing all the tf's for each document in the index
while finding cf - you can find df (no documents containing the term) by counting the 	documents finding cf


tfidf = idea that less common words like 'elephant' rather than 'the' are more useful for finding relevant documents.

DF distinguishes relevant words - not CF
Informative words are inversly related to the document frequency - i.e. 'the' appears in 99.9% of documents and isnt very useful BUT 'elephant' appears in 2% of documents and is very informative.

|D|/dfw = inverse document frequency # take log to moderate
>> the value == more relavant i.e. idf(try) = 0.057 // idf(mischief) = 1.456

you need to do:
tf.log(|D|/dfw)
BUT not all terms descrive a document equally well so we bring tf back in


tf = 1
3204 / 117
